# NLM/NCBI PubReader

This is a suite of Javascript and CSS files for rendering journal articles in a
PubReader™ view<sup>1</sup>.


## Quick Start

This repository includes the JavaScript library and CSS files that comprise
PubReader, as well as test/demo pages that you can view right away in your browser.

To try it out, simply clone the repository to a directory on your hard drive:

    git clone https://github.com/NCBITools/PubReader.git

And then, in your browser, open one of the files in the `test` directory.  For
example, `PubReader/test/test-article1.html`.  It should work fine viewing articles
either directly on your filesystem (the "file:" protocol) or, over an HTTP server
("http:"), if you clone to a location that is served by one.

The `test` directory also includes a simple script that will convert some XML
files which contain article sources into HTML.  For more information, see the
instructions under the [test](test) directory.
